# Getting Started
- Getting started is very simliar for all of the AWS plugins by eelDev and the reason why everything is gathered on one page, the only difference when initializing the plugins is the name of the "create game lift object"-node and the name of the service in the AWS console.

1. Start by [Creating a IAM user](../../creating_user.md) for the service
2. Then you [Initialize the plugin](../../initializing_plugin.md) 
3. After that you are ready to start [using the plugin](../../using_plugin.md)
