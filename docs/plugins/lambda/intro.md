# Introduction

## Features
- This plugin enables you to execute Amazon Lambda queries inside Unreal Engine.
- AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume – there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service – all with zero administration.
- You can also build serverless applications composed of functions that are triggered by events and automatically deploy them using CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild. For more information, see [AWS Lambda applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html).
